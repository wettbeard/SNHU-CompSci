Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room makes “Draw It or Lose It,” a guessing game app. They wanted it to run on multiple OS as a web-based game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I picked the correct technologies that matched each requirement.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Writing the document first helped me break the process into modular steps or requirements. It makes sense that you would have to back up your recommendations with the appropriate reasoning, but I had never dove as deeply into the why.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel like I could have done better on the Memory Management portion.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs as accessibility across various platforms and performance. The users must be catered towards to an extent as they are your customers.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I am making a database website for my workplace, and I will be using this document as a tool to analyze the database software I am making.
